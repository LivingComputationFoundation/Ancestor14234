# Ancestor14234
Archive of the bespoke physics demonstrated in the paper "A Robust Programmable Replicator for an Indefinitely Scalable Machine"

**Note This Is An Archived Snapshot Of Research Code And Is Wholly Unsupported.**

## Possible Path To Run The Code

0. Be on linux (tested on Ubuntu)
1. Install MFM and ULAM and get an `ulam -i` demo working
2. Configure lines 11-12 of Make-dispatch.sh to point at your MFM and ULAM
3. Run `make` at the top-level to build `Ancestor14234.mfz`
4. Run `make run` at the top-level to run the bespoke physics
5. Type `t` to bring up the tool palette, then
6. Find and click on the 'element box' labeled `S`, then
7. Click somewhere in the grey area to create an instance of `S`, then
8. Click the `Run` button to start the `mfms` engine.
